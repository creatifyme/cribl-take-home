# Crible Take Home Test

### Questions I asked after receiving the coding challenge

- Timebox: The email says "completed project within one week" but is there a time limit I should be targeting?
  - Answer not given and I was instructed to use my best guess
- Since this is not a full stack position, should I be working under the assumption that I'm developing against an API contract using the Interface that's defined in step 6?
  - Answer not given and I was instructed to use my best guess
- I was thinking of using a JSON file with mock data to use for rendering the UI
  - Answer not given and I was instructed to use my best guess
- When the user clicks on the file, should it prompt them to download/view it in the browser or is this for browsing purposes only?
  - I was told this wasn't needed
- Is there a set list of file extensions? The example shows "rtf" and "txt", but I wasn't sure if we're supporting other file extensions like PDF or images.
  - Answer not given and I was instructed to use my best guess
- Should the files/folders be rendered alphabetical regardless of their type or should they be sorted alphabetically with folders first and then display the files?
  - Answer not given and I was instructed to use my best guess
- Based on the Interface on step 6, it shows that "size" isn't optional which then would mean we should have size for the Folders. Should we be displaying size for both folders and files? The mockup only shows displaying size for files.
  - Answer not given and I was instructed to use my best guess
- Should the display table be sortable by the columns(Name, Size, Date)?
  - Answer not given and I was instructed to use my best guess
